# Find the minimum spanning tree among a bunch of cities using Kruskal's algorithm

A command-line program that uses Kruskal's algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree of a graph. The graph is provided in the form of an adjacency list as a file named assn9_data.csv.
  

Outputs each edge of the minimum spanning tree as the names of the two cities and the distance between them.
Also prints the sum of all of the distances in the tree.
