# Maze creation using Disjoint Set data structure

The Disjoint Set data structure used in the creation of a maze is written by author Mark Allen Weiss.


Generate and display a maze as a command-line program that generates a character-based maze.

The user can specify the number of rows and columns in the maze, up to 20x20. (It could have been a maze with higher dimension too, but if it becomes too huge then command line argument window cannot accomodate characters in a single line and the maze becomes a mess.)
      
Run the program. Save your maze in a text editor. Print it out and give it to your kiddos to solve the maze. Print out a bigger maze each day and challenge them!
